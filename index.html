    <main id="about-me">

      <p>Hello! My name is Chandradat Gir, and I am an Backend Software Engineer working towards being a Fullstack Engineer.  I am formerly from Guyana where I learned Database Application Programming on the job without any prior computer skills. <br><br> I worked with dBase-IIIPlus in a DOS environment. I also worked with FoxPro.<br><br>
      I migrated to New York in December 2005. I worked in Real Estate after which I commenced my studies for my Bachelor of Technology Degree. I major in Computer Systems Technology(CST) from CUNY New York City College of Technology. This has sharpened by skills in Object Oriented Programming with Java.<br> <br>
        In College I worked on VMWare creating pools of virtual computers and virtualizing software with ThinApps. <br>
		After graduation I worked on Java Development on Spring Framework with Maven.
        <br><br>
        Currently I am part of CUNY TechWorks Program, learning and developing my skills in Website Development. I am looking towards  being a Fullstack Software Engineer.
